          | A ninja (忍者) or shinobi (忍び) was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan. 
          | The functions of the ninja included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, assassination and guerrilla warfare. 
          | Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the samurai, who observed strict rules about honor and combat. 
          | The shinobi proper, a specially trained group of spies and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period, but antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.
